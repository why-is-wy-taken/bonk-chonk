Bonk Chonk todo list

This is a list of shit that I need to get done for this to be considered alpha 
software to me.

- 10 levels
- Collectibles in each level
- Real sprites (no simple squares!)

These 10 levels will be super simplistic in order to have the user understand 
how the game works. There will also be enemies added to these levels once I 
get around to that in Beta 2.


Here is a list of other things to do. These can be done whenever as long as it 
gets done!!

- Debug menu (increase speed of users/objects, enemy placement, etc...)
- Title screen
- Level creator(Maybe doesn't have to be done since godot can make adding 
    levels easy?)
